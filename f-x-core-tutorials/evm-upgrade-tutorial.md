# Upgrading Your Node

### f(x)Core Network Upgrades

16th July 2022 at block height `5,713,000`: Upgrade `v2.1.1` introduces a new module `evm` which will enable `ethereum` compatibility.

Coming soon: Stablecoins (usdt) on multiple chains (eth/bsc/polygon/tron) cross-chain to fxCore evm through gravity.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**WARNING**</mark>

There are 2 types of network upgrades with similar steps but it is IMPORTANT to identify which to perform prior to the upgrade as hard fork required to do it before the height and proposal are after the height



#### **Hard fork upgrade:**

The code after the upgrade is backward compatible, so the node _**can (and needs to) be updated before the upgrade height**_, and when the upgrade height is reached, the node will automatically switch to the new logic



**Proposal upgrade:**

When the upgrade proposal is passed, _**we also need to wait for the block height to reach the upgrade height set in the proposal. We cannot use the new program to update the node in advance**_, because the code after the upgrade is backward incompatible. When the block height reaches the upgrade height, the node will automatically stop producing blocks and print the log: "ERR UPGRADE" upgrade proposal plan name "NEEDED at height: upgrade proposal set height...", and then we can use the latest program to update the node

### Upgrade steps

1. Ensure you have stopped the node‚ùó

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="With Daemon" %}
```
sudo systemctl stop fxcored
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="With PID" %}
```
ps -ef | grep fxcored
kill -9 <PID>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

2\. Pulling the latest fx-core code base (ensure that you are in the fx-core folder):

```
git pull
```

3\. Checkout the branch of the upgrade version:

```shell
git checkout <upgradeable version branch>
```

for example:

```
git checkout release/v2.1.x
```

4\. Update fxcored (ensure that you are in the fx-core folder):

```
make go.sum
make install
```

5\. Cross reference the latest commit hash to the commit in our [official github page](https://github.com/FunctionX/fx-core):

```
fxcored version
```

6\. Running the following command will add EVM configurations to the **`app.toml`** and **`config.toml` ** files:

```
fxcored config update
```

Check evm configuration is added successfully:

```
fxcored config app.toml
```

Return (you should see an EVM configuration):

```
...
evm:
  max-tx-gas-wanted: 500000
  tracer: ""
...
json-rpc:
  address: 0.0.0.0:8545
  api:
  - eth
  - net
  - web3
  block-range-cap: 10000
  enable: true
  evm-timeout: 5e+09
  feehistory-cap: 100
  filter-cap: 200
  gas-cap: 2.5e+07
  http-idle-timeout: 1.2e+11
  http-timeout: 3e+10
  logs-cap: 10000
  txfee-cap: 1
  ws-address: 0.0.0.0:8546
...
```

7\. Restart the node:

```
sudo systemctl restart fxcored
```

8\. Check whether the node is participating in consensus:

```
cat $HOME/.fxcore/data/priv_validator_state.json
```

It should return something similar to the following:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can cross reference the block "height" field with that of the [FunctionX Explorer](https://dhobyghaut-explorer.functionx.io/fxcore/blocks)
{% endhint %}

```

  "round": 0,
  "step": 3,
  "signature": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "signbytes": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

> Users can specify the configuration of certain commands in the configuration file `client.toml`

> A point to note is that client.toml configuration are for fxcored CLI, while app.toml and config.toml are configurations for the node.

Modify client.toml command `fxcored config $key $value` (example):

```
fxcored config chain-id fxcore

fxcored config keyring-backend test

fxcored config output json

fxcored config node "tcp://127.0.0.1:26657"

fxcored config broadcast-mode block
```
