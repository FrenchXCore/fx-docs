> Snapshots are performed every Monday morning at 2:00 am UTC, keeping a record of that snapshot for three weeks. If the date on the file above is not yet updated and more than a week has lapsed since the last snapshot, you may replace the date (to the latest Monday's date) in the file name to get the latest snapshot.

## Using Snapshots

First, you need to set your node up with the pre-requisites as per the node [setup guide](use-snapshot.md). Before you `start node` for fxcore to sync, follow the below steps to use snapshot:

Download the Snapshot to your VM. To download the Snapshot Tar file to your VM you can run the following command:

```bash
wget -c <Snapshot URL>
```

For example:

```bash
wget -c https://fx-testnet.s3.amazonaws.com/fxcore-snapshot-2021-10-18.tar.gz
```

This will download the Snapshot of fxcore

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to ensure that youâ€™re running this command before you `Start` your node. If your fxcore node has already started, please stop it and then run the command below. Once unpacking is complete you can start the fxcore service again.
{% endhint %}

Now, to unpack the `tar` file in the fxcore Data directory run the following command:

```bash
tar -xzvf <snapshot file> -C <FXCORE_DATA_DIRECTORY>
```

For example:

```bash
tar -xzvf fxcore-snapshot-2021-10-11.tar.gz -C ~/.fxcore/data/
```

Note that if your fxcore data directory is named differently then please rename that directory.
