# Overview

All proposals are to be voted on-chain. Prior to on-chain voting, it is paramount that the proposer follows the following set of guidelines to ensure a greater chance that their proposal will be passed.

These guidelines are written in order to:

1. Propose best practices for drafting a proposal
2.  Address the issue of reaching quorum for the reasons stated below:&#x20;

    1. public validators not controlling enough FX currently, and
    2. Internal and institutional validators are not voting to maintain neutrality

3. Allow for the FunctionX team to indirectly exercise their voting power (uniquely from a delegator’s standpoint, and not from a validator’s standpoint) with full knowledge that the proposal was reviewed preliminarily by skilled peers

In that perspective, each proposal shall lead to:

1. The designation of 3 team developers, for each proposal that reaches out to the committee:
The internal developers are chosen based on their skillset; hence, a market-making proposal will be judged by traders/trading system engineers, while a  say - NFT proposal will be judged by a smart contract developer.
2. The assignment:
Team will designate voting power to each committee member such that each committee member will control 5% of the network’s voting power
3. Each committee member acts independently. The proposer will obtain 5% vote from each of the 3 committee members if their proposal passes each committee member’s assessment. If it passes all committee member’s assessment then the proposal would have achieved 15% “yes”.
