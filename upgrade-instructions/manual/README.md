# Manual Upgrade Guide V5.0.x

{% hint style="warning" %}
❗️Please note that the current fxCore Mainnet v5.0.x upgrade, the upgrade height is 11,601,700, and the upgrade countdown is [**Countdown Timer**](https://functionx.github.io/fx-core/tools/countdown.html?network=mainnet).
{% endhint %}

Here is the guide to manually upgrade `fxcored`, If you are running a validator node, we recommend integrating [cosmovisor](../cosmovisor/) , Cosmovisor can help validators automatically complete node upgrades when they reach the upgrade height, improving the operating efficiency of nodes.
