# Manual Upgrade Guide

{% hint style="warning" %}
❗️Please note that the current fxCore testnet v4 upgrade, the upgrade height is `8088000`, and the upgrade countdown is [**Countdown Timer**](https://functionx.github.io/fx-core/tools/countdown.html?network=testnet).
{% endhint %}

Here is the guide to manually upgrade `fxcored`, If you are running a validator node, we recommend integrating [cosmovisor](../cosmovisor/README.md) , Cosmovisor can help validators automatically complete node upgrades when they reach the upgrade height, improving the operating efficiency of nodes.
