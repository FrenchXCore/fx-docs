# f(x)Core Developer Documentation

The overall flow for setting up the Testnet validator is:

* [Installing f(x)Core](tutorials/installation.md)

> fxcored similar to Ethereum geth, is a command-line interface for implementing an f(x)Core node.

* Setup a full-node. You may choose to either set it up with [Docker](tutorials/full-node-with-docker.md) or with [Binaries](tutorials/full-node-with-binaries.md), [Docker](tutorials/full-node-with-docker.md) is preferred.

> fxcored is a daemon, after running a full-node, it will be running in the background.

* Only after you have set up a full-node, can you move on to setting up a [Setting Up a Validator for f(x)Core Testnet](validators/validator-setup.md).
